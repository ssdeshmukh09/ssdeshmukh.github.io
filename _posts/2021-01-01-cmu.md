Summarising the post in a sentence <i>"It was hard, but totally worth it!"</i>. So I graduated with masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from CMU, which consisted of three semester from August 2019 to December 2020, in which I did 9 courses (7 PhD level). My research focused on topics in speech, specifically audio and voice analysis and was advised by [Prof. Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/) and [Prof. Rita Singh](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/rsingh/) at [MLSP](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/). 

The research I did resulted in three publications (two ICASSP, one INTERSPEECH), but more importantly it taught me how to approach and think about hard problems. I got a lot of opportunities like interacting with speech experts during COVID19 project, during the research talk I gave at MIT CSAIL [SLS group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/), summer internship and so on. Also research is hard with ups and downs, but the ride is definitely enjoyable if you have the right mindset. And what worked for me is having something to decompress after a long week of work. This can be anything ranging from hobbies like painting, jiu-jitsu, or simple things like workouts, grabbing beer with friends etc.

I guess in all what CMU taught me is <i>how to approach hard problems</i> and provided me with right <i>mathematical and theortical background</i> to solve them.

Some photos with memories and the friendships I will cherish forever:
