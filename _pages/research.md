My research interest lies in analysing and understanding audio signals with text groundings. This involves both paralinguistic and non semantic application tasks like audio scene understanding, sound event detection, voice-based medical diagosis, speech emotion recognition etc. With respect to area, my work lies at the intersection of audio processing, natural language understanding and representation learning.
