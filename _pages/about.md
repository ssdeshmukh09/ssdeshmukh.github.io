I am an applied scientist at Microsoft. I am interested in weakly supervised learning with applications in audio scene understanding and task oriented natural language understanding. Work research page here: [Soham at MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sdeshmukh/)

I received my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University where my research was advised by [Prof. Bhiksha Raj](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/bhiksha/) and [Prof. Rita Singh](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/people/rsingh/) at [MLSP](http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/). Prior to CMU, I received my B.Tech from Department of Electrical Engineering, [VJTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veermata_Jijabai_Technological_Institute), where I worked with [Prof. Faruk Kazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti/) in the area of threat modelling and natural language processing. 

Professionally, I spent my summers interning at Microsoft, Siemens R&D, Siemens and winning some Kaggle medals in competitions by [Google](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge), [Quora](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).
